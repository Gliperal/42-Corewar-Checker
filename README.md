Note that the tests bundled with this repository are tailored for 42's Corewar. Attempting to use this checker versus the Epitech Corewar may produce incorrect test results at best and undefined behavior at worst.
Any time the output of corewar is changed, setup.sh should be run again.

Before using:
	./setup.sh /path/to/corewar/directory

To run:
	TODO
